# MySQL-Data-Cleaning-Project

This project demonstrates data cleaning techniques and transformation using MySQL.

## Project Description
- **Objective**: Cleaned and transformed a dataset to prepare it for analysis and reporting and for Further Exploratory Data Analysis. Also done the EDA of the dataset.
- **Key Processes**: Identified and removed duplicates, handled null values, standardized formats, and optimized data structure.

## Files
- `data_cleaning_script.sql`: Contains SQL queries for data cleaning steps.
- `layoff.csv`: Original dataset before cleaning.
- `cleaned_dataset.csv`: Final dataset after cleaning.
- `EDA.sql`: The sql Scripts of Further EDA done on the same Dataset.

## Results
- **Error Reduction**: 65% reduction in data errors.
- **Processing Efficiency**: 20% reduction in processing time.
- **Data Consistency**: Standardized 100% of date and date formats and also removing NULL values Data.

## How to Use
- Run the SQL scripts in the order provided to replicate the cleaning process and the EDA.
